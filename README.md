# PerspectivesX

PerspectivesX is an LTI tool designed to scaffold collaborative learning activities within MOOCs and LMSs.  PerspectivesX promotes learner knowledge construction and curation for a range of multi-perspective elaboration techniques (e.g., SWOT analysis and Six Thinking Hats).

Learner submissions are stored in a searchable knowledge base which is able to be persisted across course re-runs and promotes the use of natural language processing techniques to allow course moderators to provide scalable feedback.

A [Work In Progress paper was accepted at EMOOCs 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04846) which detailed the the design principles that underpin the  PerspectivesX tool. The paper includes screen mockups.
